**Flower Object Detection**

Object detection is the computer vision task of detecting instances (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in an image. Object detection models receive an image as input and output coordinates of the bounding boxes and associated labels of the detected objects. An image can contain multiple objects, each with its own bounding box and a label (e.g., it can have a car and a building), and each object can be present in different parts of an image (e.g., the image can have several cars). This task is commonly used in autonomous driving for detecting things like pedestrians, road signs, and traffic lights. Other applications include counting objects in images, image search, and more.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

Finetune DETR, a model that combines a convolutional backbone with an encoder-decoder Transformer, on the CPPE-5 dataset.
Use your finetuned model for inference.
